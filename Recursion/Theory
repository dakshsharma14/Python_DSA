def open_gift():
    if ball:
        return ball    =>   Base Case, where the function stops
    else:
        open_gift()    =>   Recursive Case


If no base case, it will be infinite and it will be stack overflow
Base Class should have the return statement not the print, otherwise the run statement will go to next line


In Python, each time a function (recursive or otherwise) is called, a structure
known as an activation record or frame is created to store information about
the progress of that invocation of the function.
